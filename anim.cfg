// This is an example config for a part that has three individual animations:
//
//	BelugaDoorsal
//	BelugaDoorVentral
//	BelugaRamp
//
// The animations proceed in order.  
//
// Opening sequence:
//
// The opening sequence starts with the first animation (ie:  the one with no parent).  This implies
// that the order is determined by the parent/child relationship and not the order in the file
// A child is started when the animation percent reaches the value specified in the "allowChildanimAt" value
//
// Example
//	 Open event starts the first animation (BelugaDoorsal)
//	 The second animation (BelugaDoorVentral) starts when the first 
//	 animation (BelugaDoorsal) reaches 50% opening.  
//	 The third animation starts when the second reaches 55% opening (0.55)
//
// Closing sequence
//
// The closing sequence works the same as the opening sequence, except 
// that the order is reversed, and the parent starts when the current
// animation reaches the value specified in the "allowParentAnimAt"
